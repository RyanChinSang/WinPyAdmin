v1.0 (30.04.17)
tldr; Initial Release
01- Committed initial release to git.

v1.1a (01.05.17)
tldr; Added function to hide the elevated window. Clean-up code.
01- Added modWin(name) function that is able to perform some action on the Window with a string
    'name' based on the action specified by the optional 'opt' argument.
    a. modeWin(name) defaults to hiding the Window with the passed string parameter 'name'.
    b. modWin(name) behaviour can be changed using the 'opt=' argument.
    c. If 'opt' is not specified, then the behaviour defaults to showing the window normally.
    d. If 'opt' is incorrectly set, a warning message is printed.
    NB: all opt actions were taken from win32con.py.
02- Updated the raise statements from the depreciated syntax.
03- Removed unnecessary lines of code.
04- Moved 'import ctypes' statement to the top of file - standard formatting.
05- Renamed some interior variable names to conform to PEP8.
    a. For example, cmdLine is now changed to cmd_line.
    NB: A conscious decision was made to not change the name of functions, despite the fact that
        they do not conform to PEP8.
06- Refined exception statements' wording to be more clear.
07- Added and refined comments to be more clear.
08- Added various comments with TODOs - to easier locate the lines to be looked at later.
09- Updated example with modWin().
