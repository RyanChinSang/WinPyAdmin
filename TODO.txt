NOTE: most TODOs are added into the code itself... see there

1. Some parts of WPA needs revision/optimization...
2. Fix ambiguity with except statement in isUserAdmin()
3. Find a function to massage command line params (not necessary - would be nice)
4. Fix unresolved references in imports for shellcon and ShellExecuteEx
5. Make a better README.md
