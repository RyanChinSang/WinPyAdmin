# WinPyAdmin (WPA- Windows Python Admin)

Inspired by [Preston Landers' (2010) 'admin.py'](https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/ants/blob/master/admin.py.
A simple python 2.7+ tool for Windows XP SP2+ (and later) to make an elevated python console window with Administrator privileges. This triggers Windows' UAC for user confirmation so as to make the elevated window.
